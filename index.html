    <p>My name is <b>Ashton Jacobs</b>, and I'm a nerd who aspires towards learning more about computers. My goal one day is to 
      major in <i>Computer Science</i>, specifically in the branch of <i>Cyber Security</i> where I hope to become a skilled 
      <b>Ethical</b> (Or White Hat) <b>Hacker</b>.<br/>With this main goal in mind, I've been taking many steps to work towards
      the best possible future of this career such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning Programming Languages</li>
      <li>Researching Career Paths</li>
      <li>Applying Findings</li>
      <li>And Challenging Myself to Keep Doing What I Love</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the end, I love learning and I'm always seeking to improve, and I feel as though that's one of the reasons why it's 
      hard for me to give up on any of this</p>
